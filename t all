    Fix symlink handling crashes in tasty-discover (resolves #38)
    
    - Update to symlink-aware Glob library version to prevent crashes on symlinked directories
    - Replace globDir1 with globDirWith for better directory handling
    - Add comprehensive test coverage for symlink scenarios with platform-aware skipping
    - Implement runtime OS detection to skip symlink tests on Windows (no CPP required)
    - Filter out directories during glob processing to prevent "withFile: inappropriate type" errors
    - Add detailed documentation about symlink support limitations on Windows
    - Update CHANGELOG.md and README.md with platform compatibility notes
    
    Changes:
    * cabal.project: Pin to haskell-works/glob with symlink support
    * Driver.hs: Use globDirWith instead of globDir1, add directory filtering
    * ConfigTest.hs: Add spec_symlinksNotFollowed test with Windows compatibility
    * Documentation: Add FAQ section and configuration notes about symlink limitations
    
    The fix ensures tasty-discover gracefully handles symlinked directories on Unix-like
    systems while automatically skipping symlink-related tests on Windows to maintain
    cross-platform compatibility.

    Add reproduction test for symlink crash issue (#38)
    
    Create failing test that demonstrates tasty-discover crashes when encountering
    symlinked directories with "withFile: inappropriate type (is a directory)" error.
    
    Changes:
    * test/ConfigTest.hs: Add spec_symlinksNotFollowed test that reproduces the bug
      - Creates temporary directory with real test files and symlinked directory
      - Calls tasty-discover and expects it to crash with specific error message
      - Includes comprehensive error reporting and directory structure debugging
      - Test is designed to fail until issue #38 is fixed
    
    * tasty-discover.cabal: Add required dependencies for symlink testing
      - process: For running tasty-discover subprocess
      - temporary: For creating temporary test directories
      - directory, filepath: For file system operations
    
    * test/Driver.hs: Integrate new symlink test into test suite
    
    The test currently fails as expected, demonstrating the crash that occurs when
    tasty-discover encounters symlinked directories during test discovery. This
    provides a clear reproduction case for debugging and validates the fix once
    implemented.

    Add comprehensive skip test functionality with Flavored transformations
    
    Implements a complete skip test system for tasty-discover with:
    
    Features:
    - SkipTest option type with IsOption instance for Tasty integration
    - skip :: TestTree -> TestTree function for marking tests as skipped
    - Flavored type for general-purpose TestTree transformations
    - Yellow [SKIPPED] output with ANSI terminal colors
    - Integration with custom test types via Tasty instances
    
    Implementation:
    - Add SkipTest newtype in Test.Tasty.Discover.Internal.Config
    - Add skip function and Flavored type in Test.Tasty.Discover
    - Modified Property instance to handle SkipTest option with colored output
    - Added ansi-terminal dependency for yellow coloring
    - Comprehensive documentation in README.md and CHANGELOG.md
    
    Testing:
    - Updated test suite with skip functionality demonstrations
    - All existing tests continue to pass
    - Skip tests show as [SKIPPED] in yellow and don't execute
    
    The Flavored type provides extensible design for future TestTree
    transformations like timeouts, metadata, and grouping while maintaining
    backward compatibility.

    Fix multiline block comment handling in test discovery
    
    - Add preprocessing step to remove {- -} block comments before test discovery
    - Implement proper nested block comment support with depth tracking
    - Add comprehensive test suite for comment handling scenarios
    - Export extractTests function for testing purposes
    - Resolves issue #10: tests incorrectly found in block comments
    
    The implementation uses a simple lexical analysis approach that:
    * Handles nested block comments correctly
    * Preserves line comments (no change in behavior)
    * Prevents false test discovery in commented code
    * Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality

    Fix directory handling in glob patterns (GitHub issue #12)
    
    Resolves the issue where directories matching glob patterns caused
    "inappropriate type (is a directory)" errors when using the --modules flag.
    
    The problem occurred when glob patterns matched both files and directories,
    and tasty-discover tried to read directories as files.
    
    Changes:
    - src/Test/Tasty/Discover/Internal/Driver.hs:
      * Added filterM doesFileExist to filesByModuleGlob function
      * Added Control.Monad and System.Directory imports
    - test/ConfigTest.hs: Added spec_modulesGlobIgnoresDirectories regression test
    - test/ModulesGlob/: Created test data to verify directory filtering
    - tasty-discover.cabal: Added directory dependency and new test modules
    
    Before: Directories matching glob patterns caused crashes
    After: Directories are silently filtered out, only files processed
    
    Example that now works:
      tasty-discover . _ out --modules='*'
    
    Fixes: GitHub issue #12

    - Fixed file discovery pattern from "*.hs*" to "*.hs" in Driver.hs
    - Prevents backup files (.hs.orig, .hs.bak) from being processed as test modules
    - Added regression test spec_backupFilesIgnored to prevent future regressions
    - Created test/BackupFiles/ directory with test data to verify fix
    - Updated cabal file to include new test module
    
    Fixes issue where files like "Foo.hs.orig" would generate invalid imports
    like "import qualified Foo.hs" instead of being ignored.
    
    Before: Files matching "*.hs*" included backup files
    After: Only files ending with ".hs" are processed

    Fix tasty-hedgehog `testProperty` deprecation warning
    
    Compiling `hprop_` tests would cause the following warning:
    
    ```
    Deprecated: "testProperty will cause Hedgehog to provide incorrect instructions for re-checking properties"
    ```
    
    The recommended solution is to use `testPropertyNamed` instead.
